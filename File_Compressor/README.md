This is a File Compressor App built in python 3 
It uses libraries like 
zlib for compression, 
tkinter for gui
os, sys for other utility functions

This app works best on text files and similar formats.
Althogh it can still take image files, mp3 files, video files or pdf as input, i do no recommend to do you so.
